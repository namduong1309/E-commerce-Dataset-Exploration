## Introduction
In this project I wrote queries in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset of AdventureWorks. 
The AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer (Adventure Works Cycles). Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources.
## Insight
1. Total visits and pageviews both decreased in February and increased in March 2017, while total transactions increased slightly in February and increased sharply in March. This shows the high average transaction rate per visitor in February and customer accessibility increased significantly in March.
